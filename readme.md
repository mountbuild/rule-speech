<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

Tune speech is a collection of made up sound-sequences (a.k.a. "words"), which don't belong necessarily to any language. Instead they belong to the Earth's languages. It aims to teach you how to pronounce any word in the world. Given that you are able to do that, you can go into Russian, or Hebrew, or Chinese, or Navajo, or Zulu, and speak it like you know what you are talking about.

Tune speech is being developed by the folks at [Mount](https://mount.build), a California-based project for helping humanity master information and computation. Mount started off in the winter of 2008 as a spark of an idea, to forming a company 10 years later in the winter of 2018, to a seed of a project just beginning its development phases. Mount funds tune speech's development. It is entirely bootstrapped by working full time and running [Etsy](https://etsy.com/shop/mountbuild) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=p_27%3AMount+Build) shops. Also find us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mountbuild), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mountbuild), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mountbuild).
